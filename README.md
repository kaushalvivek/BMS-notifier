# Movie Ticket Availability Notifier

There have been times when I wanted to, but could not watch a movie on its first
weekend because I was late in booking the tickets. This crontask script will
notify you, when tickets to the target movie are available, so you never miss a
first-day-first-show again.

This is a Crontask for notification on availability of tickets for a new movie.

*BookMyShow is used for scraping availability, so check if your city has bookings through BMS before using.*

## Pre-requisites:
1. [Crontasks](https://awc.com.my/uploadnew/5ffbd639c5e6eccea359cb1453a02bed_Setting%20Up%20Cron%20Job%20Using%20crontab.pdf)
2. Python Libraries:-
    - bs4
    - requests
    - smtp
    - time
    - argparse (included by default)

## How to Use:

Fill up the below section in ```main.py``` before setting up the crontask.
This can be found at line 12 onwards.

```md
# FILL THIS UP OTHERWISE THE SCRIPT WON'T RUN

```

Add the file path, date and time for running and excution command in ```crontab -e```.

```md
